# ai

- ai yeah woohoo

the reason why I made this is to get in Adv. CS

although it is a bit of a big deal,
as this is my first working nn...

this also taught me a teeny bit about time management. (good thing dates are recorded in gh)

i genuinely forgot to create what the ai would "train" from, so i'll use the oxford-3000 and make them predict the word from the first 3-4 letters. (._.)

i have used chatgpt and replit's in-built artificial but (helpful) intelligence for this project, and to be honest, i haven't really learnt any prompt engineering. but who needs that? œ∑á¥üâøπåß∂ƒ©˙∆˚¬Ω≈ç∫ñµŒ„´‰Á¨ˆØ∏ÍÎÏ˝ÓÔÒ¸˛Ç◊ı˜Â
however, i did have a bit of fun w/ chatgpt. i made it try to guess what i was working on, and it got it correct.
